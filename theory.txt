What happens if size of packet changes?

Answer: Better performance, it simply comes down to the packets becoming full less often. 

This is explained by the fact that when a packet is full, this can cause threads to yield.
Yielding is the process of fetching the cpu in order to put the current thread at the back
of the queue. Yielding requires more time to execute, hence why using a bigger packet is
better for performance.
